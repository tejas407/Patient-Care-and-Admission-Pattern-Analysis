# Patient Care and Admission Pattern Analysis
### Project Description -
This project focuses on analyzing a hospital's patient and admission data to extract actionable insights. 
We used SQL and Python to explore key areas, such as patient demographics, admission trends, and doctor 
efficiency. The insights derived from these analyses can help hospital management and staff improve resource 
allocation, understand patient profiles, and streamline hospital operations.
The following queries represent the specific objectives we set out to address in this project. Each query 
is framed as a business question, aimed at improving the hospitalâ€™s operational and service standards.

### Problem Statement -
The healthcare industry often deals with complex data involving patient demographics, admission 
trends, and doctor performance, which are crucial for making informed business and clinical decisions. To 
assist our hospital in enhancing patient care, operational efficiency, and strategic planning, we conducted a 
detailed analysis of patient and admission data. The objective of this project is to uncover insights related to 
patient demographics, analyze admission patterns, and evaluate doctor performance to support data-driven 
decision-making.
